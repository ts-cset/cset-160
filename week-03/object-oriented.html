## Lecture .eight[06]

# Object Oriented Programming

class: middle, center

# .eleven[Rule #1: Don't think about JavaScript Objects.]

# Agenda

1. [ ] [Dictionaries](#dicts)
2. [ ] [Modules](#modules)
3. [ ] [Classes](#classes)

---
name: dicts

# Dictionaries

- Lists use integers as indexes
- Dicts use anything as indexes

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print(my_list[1])
# 'b'

my_dict = { 'name': 'Zach', 'age': 29 }
print(my_dict['name'])
# 'Zach'
```

---

# Dictionaries

.eleven[Stop thinking about JavaScript Objects.]

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict.name
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'name'
```

---

# Dictionaries

- Key: Value pairs
- Keys can be many types, stick to strings and numbers
- Keys must be unique
- Dicts are not ordered like Lists are

Terms in other languages: hash, map, associative array

---

# Dictionaries

Change value by key, just like Lists

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
my_list[1] = 'z'
print(my_list)
# ['a', 'z', 'c', 'd']

my_dict = { 'name': 'Zach', 'age': 29 }
my_dict['name'] = 'z'
print(my_dict)
# { 'name': 'z', 'age': 29 }
```

---

Add new key: value pairs:

```python
my_dict['new'] = 'thing'
print(my_dict)
# { 'name': 'z', 'age': 29, 'new': 'thing' }
```

Can remove key: value pairs:
```python
del my_dict['new']
print(my_dict)
# { 'name': 'z', 'age': 29 }
```

---

# [Exercise 31](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex31.py)

- Practice *mapping* values and keys
- Add some mappings for other states and cities
- Look up documentation on dictionaries. What else can we do with them?

???
`list(my_dict)`
`'key' in my_dict`
loop through dict
dict comprehension

---
name: modules

# Modules

A separate file with functions or variables that you can use in other files.

```python
# mystuff.py
def apple:
  print("I AM APPLE!")

# script.py
import mystuff
mystuff.apple()
```

---

# Modules

Kind of like a Dictionary:

```python
mystuff['apple'] # get apple from dict
mystuff.apple() # get apple from module
mystuff.orange # same thing, but just a variable
```

Common pattern, .eight[Get X from Y], but using a different syntax.

---
name: classes

# Classes

Another way to store functions and variables in a container:

```python
class MyStuff(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.orange = "Apples aren't oranges."

    def apples(self):
        print("I AM A CLASSY APPLE!")
```

---

# Classes

- Looks like a complicated "mini-module"
- Forget about .eight[__init__] and .eight[self] for now
- So what's different?

You can use this MyStuff class to make many copies that won't interfere with each other.

Importing a module just gives you one copy to use for the entire program.

---

# Objects

```python
thing = MyStuff()
thing.apple()
print(thing.orange)
```

We used a class to create, or .eight[instantiate], an object.

---

# Object Instantiation

1. Sees .eight[MyStuff()] and recognizes a class.
2. Creates an empty object with all the functions in the class.
3. Uses the special .eight[__init__] function to customize it.
4. The special variable .eight[self] is this new object.
5. Assigns the new object to your variable .eight[thing].

# .eight[Classes are blueprints to create objects]

---

# Get X From Y

We now have three ways:
```python
# dict style
mystuff['apple']

# module style
import mystuff
mystuff.apple

# class style
thing = MyStuff()
thing.apple
```

---

# [Exercise 32](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex32.py)

- Use the Song class to instantiate three more song objects.
- Can you pass the song lyrics to the Class as a variable instead of passing them directly?
- See if you can make the class do more things.
- Go find an article explaining Object Oriented Programming. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it, just notice all the jargon.

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

- OOP is a way of .eight[thinking] about problems.
- You can't think it if you can't speak it.

.fourteen[Drill these words and phrases into your brain:]

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

- **class**: blueprint to make a new thing
- **object**: the most basic thing; an instance of a class
- **instance**: a single occurence of a class
- **self**: variable for the instance, used within the instance
- **method**: a function owned by a class
- **attribute**: a variable owned by a class

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

- **inheritance**: concept of one class getting traits from another class, like you from your parents
- **composition**: concept of one class being built up from other classes as parts, like a car having wheels
- **is-a**: phrase used to show inheritance, a "koi" **is-a** "fish"
- **has-a**: phrase used to show composition, a "koi" **has-a** "tail"

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

**class X(Y)**
"Make a class named X that is-a Y"

**class X(object): def __init__(self, J)** 
"Class X has-a __init__ that takes self and J parameters"

**class X(object): def M(self, J)**
"Class X has-a function named M that takes self and J parameters"

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

**foo = X()**
"Set foo to an instance of class X"

**foo.M(J)**
"From foo, get the M function, and call it with parameters self, J"

**foo.K = Q**
"From foo, get the K attribute, and set it to Q"

# [Exercise 33](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex33.py)

- Use the "is-a" and "has-a" phrases to replace each "??" comment in the code.
- What is the difference between .eight[class Name(object)] and .eight[class Name()]? Which should you use?
- Add some functions and variables to the classes that make them do things. How would some of these classes "inherit" these functions and variables?
- What does .eight[super()] do?
