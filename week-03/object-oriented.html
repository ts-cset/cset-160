name: dicts

# Dictionaries

- Lists use integers as indexes
- Dicts use anything as indexes

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print(my_list[1])
# 'b'

my_dict = { 'name': 'Zach', 'age': 29 }
print(my_dict['name'])
# 'Zach'
```

---

# Dictionaries

.eleven[Stop thinking about JavaScript Objects.]

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict.name
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'name'
```

---

# Dictionaries

- Key: Value pairs
- Keys can be many types, stick to strings and numbers
- Keys must be unique
- Dicts are not ordered like Lists are

Terms in other languages: [associative arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), maps, hashes

---

# Dictionaries

Change value by key, just like Lists

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
my_list[1] = 'z'
print(my_list)
# ['a', 'z', 'c', 'd']

my_dict = { 'name': 'Zach', 'age': 29 }
my_dict['name'] = 'z'
print(my_dict)
# { 'name': 'z', 'age': 29 }
```

---

Add new key: value pairs:

```python
my_dict['new'] = 'thing'
print(my_dict)
# { 'name': 'z', 'age': 29, 'new': 'thing' }
```

Can remove key: value pairs:
```python
del my_dict['new']
print(my_dict)
# { 'name': 'z', 'age': 29 }
```

---

# [Exercise 31](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex31.py)

- Practice *mapping* values and keys
- Add some mappings for other states and cities
- Look up documentation on dictionaries. What else can we do with them?

???
`list(my_dict)`
`'key' in my_dict`
loop through dict
dict comprehension

---
name: modules

# Modules

A separate file with functions or variables that you can use in other files.

```python
# mystuff.py
def apple:
  print("I AM APPLE!")

# script.py
import mystuff
mystuff.apple()
```

---

# Modules

Kind of like a Dictionary:

```python
my_dict['apple'] # get value from dict

my_stuff.orange # get value from module
my_stuff.apple() # get and call method from module
```

Common pattern for compound values, .eight[Get X from Y], but using a different syntax.

---
name: classes

# Classes

Another way to store functions and variables in a container:

```python
class MyStuff(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.orange = "Apples aren't oranges."

    def apple(self):
        print("I AM A CLASSY APPLE!")
```

---

# Classes

- Looks like a complicated "mini-module"
- Forget about .eight[__init__] and .eight[self] for now
- So what's different?

You can use this MyStuff class to make many copies that won't interfere with each other.

Importing a module just gives you one copy to use for the entire program.

---

# Objects

```python
thing = MyStuff()
thing.apple()
print(thing.orange)
```

We used a class to create, or .eight[instantiate], an object.

---

# Object Instantiation

1. Sees .eight[MyStuff()] and recognizes a class.
2. Creates an empty object with all the functions in the class.
3. Uses the special .eight[__init__] function to customize it.
4. The special variable .eight[self] is this new object.
5. Assigns the new object to your variable .eight[thing].

# .eight[Classes are blueprints to create objects]

---

# Get X From Y

We now have three ways:
```python
# dict style
mystuff['apple']

# module style
import mystuff
mystuff.apple

# class style
thing = MyStuff()
thing.apple
```

---

# [Exercise 32](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex32.py)

- Use the Song class to instantiate three more song objects.
- Can you pass the song lyrics to the Class as a variable instead of passing them directly?
- See if you can make the class do more things.
- Go find an article explaining Object Oriented Programming. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it, just notice all the jargon.

name: jargon

# Speaking Object-Oriented

- OOP is a way of .eight[thinking] about problems.
- You can't think it if you can't speak it.

.fourteen[Drill these words and phrases into your brain:]

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

- **class**: blueprint to make a new thing
- **object**: the most basic thing; an instance of a class
- **self**: variable for the instance, used within the instance
- **method**: a function owned by a class
- **attribute**: a variable owned by a class

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

- **inheritance**: concept of one class getting traits from another class, like you from your parents
- **composition**: concept of one class being built up from other classes as parts, like a car having wheels
- **is-a**: phrase used to show inheritance, a "koi" **is-a** "fish"
- **has-a**: phrase used to show composition, a "koi" **has-a** "tail"

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

```python
class Foo(Bar)
```

"Make a class named .eight[Foo] that is-a .eight[Bar]"

```python
class Foo(object): def __init__(self, bar)
```

"Class .eight[Foo] has-a constructor that takes parameters .eight[self], .eight[bar]"

```python
class Foo(object): def bar(self, baz)
```

"Class .eight[Foo] has-a .eight[bar] method that takes parameters .eight[self], .eight[baz]"

---

# Speaking Object-Oriented

```python
foo = Bar()
```

"Create an instance of the .eight[Bar] class and assign it to .eight[foo]"

```python
foo.bar(baz)
```

"From .eight[foo], get the .eight[bar] method and call it with parameters .eight[self], .eight[baz]"

```python
foo.bar = 'baz'
```

"From .eight[foo], get the .eight[bar] attribute and set it to '.eight[baz]'"
