# Agenda

1. [ ] [Using venv](#venv)
2. [ ] [Practice venv](#practice-venv)
3. [ ] [Using pip](#pip)
4. [ ] [Practice pip](#practice-pip)

name: venv

# Using venv

```bash
$ python3 -m venv &lt;dir&gt;
```

Where `&lt;dir&gt;` is the name of the virtual environment.

- This adds a directory called `&lt;dir&gt;` in the current working directory 
- It will hold Python executables and installed packages
- Your bash $PATH will get updated to look here first to run commands

---

# Using venv

- You only have to create a virtual environment once for each project.
- You can turn it on and off whenever you need to with scripts created within the new environment:

```bash
$ source &lt;dir&gt;/bin/activate
$ deactivate
```

"Activating" your environment is nothing more than a temporary change to the $PATH variable.

---

# Why venv?

- It's built in
- It's simple
- Someday we might switch to [Pipenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) (it also works on Windows)
- We used to use virtualenv, but that's old school now

Related tools: virtualenvwrapper, virtualenv-burrito, pyenv, direnv

name: practice-venv

# Practice venv

Go to your home directory, or wherever you keep your projects, and make a new project folder.

```bash
$ mkdir venv-practice
$ cd venv-practice
```

---

# Practice venv

Create the virtual environment inside your project.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ ls
venv
```
You should see the new directory.

---

# Practice venv

First, verify where your system python is and check its version. Then activate the virtual environment.

```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ python --version
Python 2.7.10
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

---

# Practice venv

If it worked, you should see a change to your bash prompt: .eight[(venv)]. You should also see a new path to the virtual environment's version of python.

```bash
(venv) $ which python
~/venv-practice/venv/bin/python
(venv) $ python --version
Python 3.7.6
```

---

# Practice venv

To stop working on this virtual environment, run the deactivate command. Now you're back to your system python path and version.

```bash
(venv) $ deactivate
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ python --version
Python 2.7.10
```

To activate it again, run the source command two slides back. Then deactivate it once more.

---

# Practice venv

Now delete this project directory, go [back to the beginning step](#practice-venv), and do it all over again.

```bash
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf venv-practice
```

Keep practicing until you can do it a few times in a row without looking at commands or making any mistakes.

---
name: pip

# Using pip

- pip is for python
- pip3 is for python3

```bash
$ pip3 --version
pip 20.0.2 from ...
```

When used outside of a virtual environment, it installs .eleven[global] packages for the system python.

---

# Using pip

To prevent this, open your .eight[~/.bashrc] file and append this line:

```
export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true
```

Save it, then open your terminal and run this command to apply it:

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

---

# Using pip

List installed packages

```bash
$ pip3 list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        20.0.2 
setuptools 42.0.2 
wheel      0.33.6 
```

These should be your only global packages. You'll put the rest in a virtual environment.

---

# Using pip

To install a package from the [Python Package Index](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-python-package-index-pypi):

```bash
(venv) $ pip3 install package_name
```

.eleven[Make sure you are in an activated virtual environment for the proper project!]

Running `pip3 list` in a virtual environment shows what is installed for that project.

---

# Using pip

You can install many packages at once, or specify versions.

```bash
$ pip3 install one two
$ pip3 install red==1.0.6
$ pip3 install blue&gt;=2.1.0
```

---

# Using pip

You can uninstall, search for, and see details on packages with these commands:

```bash
$ pip3 uninstall package_name
$ pip3 search "query"  
$ pip3 show package_name
```

---

# Using pip

Most importantly, you can save the list of packages in a file and track it with git. Then others can use the file to install all the dependencies at once.

```bash
$ pip3 freeze &gt; requirements.txt
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---
name: practice-pip

# Practice pip

Go to your home directory, or wherever you keep your projects, and make a new project folder.

```bash
$ mkdir pip-practice
$ cd pip-practice
```

Then create a new virtual environment and activate it.

---

# Practice pip

With your virtual environment active, install a third-party package.

```bash
$ pip install requests
```

---

# Practice pip

Create a script called .eight[get_ip.py] and add the following code.

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip')
data = response.json()

print(f"Your IP is {data['origin']}")
```

---

# Practice pip

Run the script and see your IP address. If it worked, then use pip to save your project's dependency.

```bash
$ python get_ip.py
Your IP is 8.8.8.8
$ pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
$ ls
get_ip.py     requirements.txt     venv
```

---

# Practice pip

Now deactivate your virtual environment and run your script again. You should get an error because now you're using your system python, not your project's local environment.

```bash
$ deactivate
$ python get_ip.py
...
ImportError: no module named requests
```

---

# Practice pip

To pretend like you are a new developer to an existing project, delete your virtual environment directory and then make a new one. Install all the dependencies at once from your file.

```bash
$ rm -rf venv
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Practice pip

The script should run again!

Deactivate the venv, delete this project directory, go [back to the beginning step](#practice-pip), and do it all over again.

```bash
$ deactivate
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf pip-practice
```

Keep practicing until you can do it a few times in a row without looking at commands or making any mistakes.

# Source Control

In these exercises, we added a few directories and files to your project:

- venv/
- requirements.txt
