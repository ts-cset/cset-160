# Python Basics in 4 Weeks

- Data Types
- Control Flow
- Inputs and Outputs
- Object Oriented Programming

---

# What We Don't Know

- Sets and Tuples
- More Number Types/Operations
- Iterators
- Generators and Decorators
- Exception Handling and the Context Manager

# Started From The Bottom

- REPL: for quick code
- Script: for longevity
- Module: for simplicity
- Package: for more simplicity

---

# Python Packages

A collection of modules

[Python Docs: Modules and Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)

---

# Application Programming

An application is software designed for end users to help them perform an activity.

- As simple as a script
- As complex as packages of packages

---

name: github

# Find Applications on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com/explore]()
2. Click on .fourteen[Topics] in the menu
3. Scroll through the list to find .fourteen[Python]
4. These repos are _related_ to Python, but we only want to see repos _written_ in Python, so select it from the .fourteen[Language] dropdown
5. Then .fourteen[Sort] by .fourteen[Most stars]

Open a few **application** repos.

---

# Find Applications on GitHub

Now make a list of common file and directory names. Don't go too deep into directories, just skim through the top level or two.

We've done this before in CSET-105.

# A Python Project

- .eight[projectname]: The application code
- .eight[bin/]: Related scripts
- .eight[docs/]: Text or web files
- .eight[tests/]: Code to test the application code
- .eight[venv/]: The virtual environment

---
name: venv

# Virtual Environment?

Time to read the docs!

[Virtual Environments and Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

---

# Installing Packages?

- Use pip!
- It stands for PIP Installs Packages
