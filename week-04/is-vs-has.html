# Speaking Object-Oriented

- **inheritance**: concept of one class getting traits from another class, like you from your parents
- **composition**: concept of one class being built up from other classes as parts, like a car having wheels
- **is-a**: phrase used to show inheritance, a "koi" **is-a** "fish"
- **has-a**: phrase used to show composition, a "koi" **has-a** "tail"
