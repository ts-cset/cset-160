# Inheritance vs Composition

---

# Agenda

1. [ ] [Implicit Inheritance](#implicit)
2. [ ] [Override Inheritance](#override)
3. [ ] [Alter Inheritance](#alter)
4. [ ] [Composition](#composition)

---
class: middle

First,

# .eleven[Inheritance is Dangerous]

---

# Inheritance

.eight[Inheritance gives features and functionality from a generic class to a more specialized one.]

- Keeps code DRY
- Modify or add to specialized class as needed

---

# Inheritance

A .eight[sub class] inherits from a .eight[super] or .eight[base class].

Or .eight[child] and .eight[parent] classes.

---

# Three Kinds of Inheritance

Actions on the child
1. **imply** an action on the parent.
2. **override** an action on the parent.
3. **alter** an action on the parent.

---
name: implicit

# [Exercise 44A](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex44a.py)

- The .eight[pass] keyword allows you to create an empty block of code
- The sub class has no definition, but all the functionality

---
name: override

# [Exercise 44B](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex44b.py)

- Both classes have the same method, which gets called?
- Useful if you need the same interface, but different functionality

---
name: alter

# [Exercise 44C](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex44c.py)

- Again, both classes have the same interface
- Alter before or after the parent method

---

# [Exercise 44D](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex44d.py)

Shows all three kinds together in the same classes

.eleven[Before you run it, try to guess what the printed output will be!]

---

# Why .eight[super()]?

```
super(Child, self).method()
```

Go find the .eight[.method()] definition on any of the classes .eight[Child] inherits from and call it with .eight[self].

---
name: composition

# Composition

Instead of mapping a special class to a generic class, just **use** two different classes.

---

# [Exercise 44E](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex44e.py)

- In the last exercise, Child .eight[is-a] Parent
- Now, Compound .eight[has-a] Other

---

# Which should you use?

1. Avoid multiple inheritance at all costs!
2. Use composition to package together unrelated things.
3. Use inheritance *only* when there's a clear relationship within a single concept.

# Which should you use?

But as always,
